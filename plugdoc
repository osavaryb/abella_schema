Documentation for generic plugin extension for Abella
by Olivier Savary-B


The generic plugins extension to Abella allows user to create syntax extensions, macros and other tacticals without modifying the source file of the prover. Expressions are dispatched to plugins by writing the name of the plugin, followed by the expression enclosed between exclamation marks ("!"). The expression is parsed as a string, and dispatched either to process_top, if it appears at the top level of an abella file, or to process_tactic if it appears as a command (i.e. inside a theorem). process_top and process_tactic also receive a function which, given a string,  parses and process it using respectively Abella.process and Abella.process_proof.

top_command :=
 | ...
 | [plugin name] ! [ string ] !

command :=
 | ...
 | [plugin name] ! [ string ] !


  Plugins are module implementing
   process_top: (string -> unit) -> string -> unit
   process_tactic: (string -> unit) -> string -> unit
  Plugins name must be linked with their implementation by adding an entry in the Abella.plugins hashtbl.

e.g. For the Ctx plugin, schema are defined as
     Ctx ! Schema schName := ... . !
and tacticals are applied, inside a proof, as 
    Ctx! inversion H1 H2. !
